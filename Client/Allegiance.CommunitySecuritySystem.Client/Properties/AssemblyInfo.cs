// Version information for an assembly consists of the following four values:
//
//      Major Version
//      Minor Version 
//      Build Number
//      Revision
//
// You can specify all the values or you can default the Build and Revision Numbers 
// by using the '*' as shown below:
// [assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.*")]
// [assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("1.0.0.0")]

// Due to a known bug in VS2010, AssemblyVersion auto increment causes files to lock after debugging sessions.
// https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/533411?wa=wsignin1.0#
// The current workaround is to comment out the auto increment. This doesn't work reliably either.
